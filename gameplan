struct for each line

int *array;
int lengthofarray;


function that loops through the linked list, increasing a y variable for each
element in the list, and another loop going through the int array for x.

draw point at x * (diagonal-down-right offset), y * (diagonal-down-left offset),
z (which basically subtracts to y so the point goes straight up)
